    id: 6-O-methylguanine
    name: 6-methoxy-7H-purin-2-amine
    comments: A methylguanine in which the methyl group is positioned on the oxygen
      at position 6. Formed in DNA by alkylation of the oxygen atom of guanine, most
      often by N-nitroso compounds and sometimes due to methylation by other compounds
      such as endogenous S-adenosylmethionine, it base-pairs to thymine rather than
      cytidine, causing a G:C to A:T transition in DNA.
