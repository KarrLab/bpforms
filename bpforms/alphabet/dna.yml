    comments: Cysteine spontaneously loses an amine group, which is replaced 
      by a keto group at the C4-atom. This reaction occurs spontaneously and 
      all the time, and is the reason why T is used in DNA. This way, dU and 
      T can be distinguished from each other.

    comments: A methylguanine in which the methyl group is positioned on the oxygen
      at position 6. Formed in DNA by alkylation of the oxygen atom of guanine, most
      often by N-nitroso compounds and sometimes due to methylation by other compounds
      such as endogenous S-adenosylmethionine, it base-pairs to thymine rather than
      cytidine, causing a G:C to A:T transition in DNA.

      a unique site in the single-stranded genome of a bacteriophage M13mp19 derivative.
      Replication of the genome in E. coli yielded targeted mutations at a frequency
      of 0.3%; the mutations were exclusively T to C transitions.
