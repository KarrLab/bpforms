    comments: A methylguanine in which the methyl group is positioned on the oxygen
      at position 6. Formed in DNA by alkylation of the oxygen atom of guanine, most

      such as endogenous S-adenosylmethionine, it base-pairs to thymine rather than
      cytidine, causing a G:C to A:T transition in DNA.

    name: 5-fluoropyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione, 5-fluorouracil
    comments: A nucleobase analogue that is uracil in which the hydrogen at position
      5 is replaced by fluorine. It is an antineoplastic agent which acts as an antimetabolite
      - following conversion to the active deoxynucleotide, it inhibits DNA synthesis
      (by blocking the conversion of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid by the
      cellular enzyme thymidylate synthetase) and so slows tumour growth.
