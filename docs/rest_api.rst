REST API
--------

The REST JSON API enables researchers to programmatically validate and calculate the properties of biopolymer forms.

The root URL for the REST API is `https://bpforms.org/api/ <https://bpforms.org/api/>`_. The REST API provides endpoints to get a list of available alphabets, to get the monomers in an alphabet, and to calculate properties of biopolymers, optionally, at a specific pH. Please see the `inline documentation <https://bpforms.org/api/>`_ for more information.
