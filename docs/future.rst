Limitations, alternatives, and future directions
------------------------------------------------

`BpForms` has several known limitations. Here we describe these limitations and, where possible suggest alternative solutions to these limitations.

* `BpForms` cannot represent the secondary structure (e.g., base pairing) of biopolymers. Extending `BpForms` to represent secondary structure would enable `BpForms` to represent more DNA forms involved in DNA damage and repair.
* `BpForms` cannot represent branched biopolymers such as carbohydrates.
