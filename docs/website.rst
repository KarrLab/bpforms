Graphical web interface
-----------------------

The `BpForms` `website <https://bpforms.org>`_ provides a convenient interface to explore `BpForms` and calculate (bio)chemical properties of biopolymer forms.

The website provides a single input box to enter biopolymer forms. After clicking submit, the website will perform three actions

#. The website will validate the form and report any syntax errors.
#. Optionally, the website will protonate the form to the chosen pH.
#. The website will calculate the length, chemical formula, mass, and charge of the submitted form.
