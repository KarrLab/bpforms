Uses cases for epigenomics, proteomics, systems biology, synthetic biology, and proteomics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By concretely capturing the primary structure of biopolymers, `BpForms` can help facilitate a wide range of epigenomics, proteomics, proteomics systems biology, and synthetic biology research.

Please see `https://www.bpforms.org <https://www.bpforms.org>`_ for information about these use cases, including detailed examples.
